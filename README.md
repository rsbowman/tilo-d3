# Tilo D3

This is code to accompany the blog post "Graph clustering, TILO, and
interactive demos" on my blog; the url is
http://seanbowman.me/blog/tilo-demo/.  The algorithm is based on the
paper *Topological graph clustering with thin position* by Jesse Johnson.  Any
mistakes are mine, anything cool is due to him.

If you'd like to play around with the code yourself, you can `npm run build`
to get a (pretty bare) index file populated with the visualizations from the
blog post.  The tilo component is in `tilo-demo.js`, some example graphs are
in a correspondingly named file.

Please don't judge me based on this code -- I hope to have time to rewrite it
sometime soon.  It will be faster, better, nicer, more user friendly!  (If
only there were more time, sigh...)
